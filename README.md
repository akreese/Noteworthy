<h1>Noteworthy</h1>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
Noteworthy is a Flask-based web application that allows users to track their media (books, webtoons, tv shows, movies) completions through submitted forms that track user's rating, thoughts, and recommendations for the completed media. Once a user has submitted at least one form, they can view their entries in one of 4 autogenerated lists or create their own unique list to fit their needs.

 Noteworthy is a web application built using a Flask web framework. The database uses PostgreSQL, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The backend server is built using Python3 and the frontend used Jinja2 for templating, HTML, CSS for styling, and Javascript. The API routes connecting the frontend and backend relied heavily on AJAX requests and event handling. To operate the suggestion function for the forms, open source APIs (TMDB, Open Library) as well as my own self-made JSON database used a web scraping library called BeautifulSoup4.

Above is my Data Model showcasing the 5 tables that make up the database. Those tables include: users, forms, medias, form maps, and user lists.

Users are able to create a login that allows for their information to be saved and viewed at later times.

To promote user-friendliness, a suggestions option is available for users to navigate. It helps auto-fill the summary and category on the forms so users dont have to.

<h2>Bugs to Work Out:</h2>
Currently, there are a few bugs when dealing with the suggestions function in the forms. While the API for the tv shows and movies works fine, the API that is being used for the books (Open Library) currently doesnt support importing a summary for the book. We will need to either look more into it or find another open source API to use. The other bug is currently the webtoons database we created using the web scraping tool is unreadable. This will just take a little bit more time to fix.
Note: While these bugs do exist, it does not impede the overall function of the app. It just hinders how user-friendly the application can be. 

<h2>Whats to Come:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Editing lists post-creation (adding on, deleting, and renaming)</li>
  <li>Editing forms post-creation</li>
  <li>Sharing Lists with others</li>
  <li>Logout button</li>
 </ul>
